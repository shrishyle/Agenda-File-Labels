# Agenda-File-Labels
This is a simple application I use to complete a micro-task at office. I use this application to generate labels for various recipients. 
Earlier I used to do this in Microsoft word and this involved repeated copy + paste actions.
I had to check the new list of recipients, compare them with the data in the already existing list. Then create a new list of unique names.

Now with this application, I only have to work on data which is changed.
Thsi saves a lot of time and makes the thing very easy.
