# Agenda-File-Labels
This is a simple application I use to complete a micro-task at office. Basically, I use this application to generate labels for various recipients.
Earlier I used to do this in Microsoft word and this entailed repeated copy + paste actions.
I had to check the new list of recipients, compare them with the previous list, keep the common ones, add the new members delete the separated ones. This exercise then generated a list of members who are all supposed to attend a particular meeting/event.

Now with this application, I only have to work on data which is changed.
This saves a lot of time and makes the thing very easy.
